      <description>Filter the images shown in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes. This set of filtered images is known as a collection.
All images imported imported into darktable are stored in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database, along with attributes describing each image. A collection may be defined by applying filtering rules to these attributes, thus creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view and the filmstrip module.</description>

      <description>The filmstrip can be used to quickly switch between images in any darktable view. The images shown are the same as displayed in the lighttable view and are defined by the currently-selected collection.
  The filmstrip can be switched on and off using the shortcut Ctrl+F. The height of the filmstrip panel can be changed by clicking and dragging its top border.
Quickly navigate through the images in the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse.</description>

      <description>The focus peaking module allows you to identify which parts of the image are sharp and in-focus. It works both in the lighttable view, where you can easily see at a glance which images are sharp and which are blurry, and in the darkroom view, when you are processing a single image.
The module is activated by clicking on the focus-peaking icon (  ). It highlights the sharp parts of the image with a yellow, green and blue overlay:</description>

The next button controls how the data for the current mode is displayed. The three rightmost colored squares are toggles which enable or disable the display of the red, green and blue color channels.</description>

      <description>Manage tags attached to images.
Tags provide a means of adding information to images using a keyword dictionary. You can also manage tags as a hierarchical tree, which can be useful when their number becomes large. Only tags at the leaves of the tree add information to an image &amp;ndash; parent tags simply serve as categories and are are used to organise the leaf tags. For example, in the ‚Äúcolor|white‚Äù tag, ‚Äúcolor‚Äù is a category for the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù tag.</description>
